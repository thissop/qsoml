# Key Wavelength Regions and Features of Rest Frame Quasar Spectra

## Ultraviolet (UV) Region
1. **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) Line (1216 Å):**
   - Strong emission line due to hydrogen. 
   - Provides information about the ionization state and dynamics of the gas in the quasar's vicinity.

2. **C IV Line (1549 Å):**
   - Emission line from ionized carbon.
   - Useful for studying the high-velocity winds and outflows from the quasar.

3. **Mg II Line (2800 Å):**
   - Emission line from ionized magnesium.
   - Often used for black hole mass estimations and redshift measurements.

## Optical Region
1. **Hα Line (6563 Å) and Hβ Line (4861 Å):**
   - Strong Balmer series emission lines from hydrogen.
   - Important for measuring the broad-line region (BLR) and estimating black hole masses.

2. **Fe II Emission Complex:**
   - Broad emission features mainly around 2500-3000 Å and 4000-5500 Å.
   - Indicates the presence of iron and provides insights into the metallicity and physical conditions in the BLR.

3. **[O III] Line (5007 Å):**
   - Narrow emission line from doubly ionized oxygen.
   - Useful for studying the narrow-line region (NLR) and the influence of the quasar on its host galaxy.

## Infrared (IR) Region
1. **Near-IR Emission Lines (e.g., Paα at 1.875 µm, Brα at 4.05 µm):**
   - Emission lines from hydrogen.
   - Provide information about the dust obscuration and star formation in the quasar's host galaxy.

## Continuum Features
1. **Continuum Slope:**
   - The overall shape of the continuum can indicate the temperature of the accretion disk and the presence of dust.

2. **Breaks and Bumps:**
   - For example, the "big blue bump" in the UV region is associated with the accretion disk emission.
   - The "small blue bump" (2500-4000 Å) is associated with Fe II and Balmer continuum emissions.

## Absorption Features
1. **Lyman-limit System (LLS) and Damped Lyman-alpha System (DLA):**
   - Absorption features indicating the presence of intervening neutral hydrogen clouds.
   - Provide insights into the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the environments around galaxies.

2. **BAL (Broad Absorption Line) Features:**
   - Broad absorption lines indicating outflows and winds from the quasar.
   - Important for understanding feedback mechanisms in quasars.
